## Description

The macro is designed to load and use components (parts) from CADBase* in the FreeCAD.

For a component modification, sets of files for various CAD systems are loaded. Thus, only FreeCAD set files are downloaded, without downloading documentation and other information on the component.

*CADBase is a platform for publishing and sharing information about 3D components, drawings and manufacturers.

## Usage

Add target components to bookmarks (favorites) on the CADBase site. In FreeCAD will only display components that the user has bookmarked on CADBase, as well as those that have been previously downloaded.

Clicking **Update from CADBase** only updates the list of components from bookmarks active user, without downloading component modifications and files.

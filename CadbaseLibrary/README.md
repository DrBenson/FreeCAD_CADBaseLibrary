# Macro Cadbase Library

This macro allows the user to interact with CADBase (upload and download parts) via the FreeCAD interface.

CADBase is a platform for publishing and sharing information about 3D components, drawings and manufacturers.

**Important Note:**  To use the macro, you must have an account on the [CADBase Platform](https://cadbase.rs).

## Description

The macro is designed to load and use components (parts) from CADBase* in the FreeCAD.

For a component modification, sets of files for various CAD systems are loaded. Thus, only FreeCAD set files are downloaded, without downloading documentation and other information on the component.

## Install

### Addon Manager (recommended)

CADBaseLibrary is available through the FreeCAD Addon Manager:  
It is called _CADBaseLibrary_ in the Addon Repository.

In menu **Tools** select **Addon Manager**, select the **Macros** tab find _CADBaseLibrary_ in the list and click Install.  

**Important Note:** CADBaseLibrary needs FreeCAD v0.19 or above. CADBaseLibrary is **not** compatible with FreeCAD v0.18 and before. 


### Manual Installation

It is also possible to install this macro manually into FreeCAD's local macro directory. This can be useful for testing local modifications to the macro, or to remove an old stale version of the macro. 

In this case, download the Github [cadbaselibrary-freecad-master.zip](https://github.com/mnnxp/cadbaselibrary-freecad/archive/master.zip) archive from [github.com/mnnxp/cadbaselibrary-freecad](https://github.com/mnnxp/cadbaselibrary-freecad) (see [Links](#Links) for more) to a temporary directory, and extract the Zip archive. Then, remove any existing CADBaseLibrary directory from FreeCAD's local Macro directory, and copy all items (the _.gitignore_ file and _img_ folder can be ignored) of the folder *cadbaselibrary-freecad* into the directory containing all FreeCAD addon macro:

* for Windows: `C:\Users\******\AppData\Roaming\FreeCAD\Macro`
* for MacOS: `~/Library/Preferences/FreeCAD/Macro/`
* for Linux, _FreeCAD version v0.19_ : `~/.FreeCAD/Macro` 
* for Linux, _FreeCAD version v0.20_ : `~/.local/share/FreeCAD/Macro/`

**Please Note:** You can see the current path to the macro folder in the macro settings by opening **Macro** in the ToolBar, selecting **Macros...** and the path to the location of custom macros. will appear at the bottom of the window.

### Instalation Blake3

To use this macro to update files already in the CADBase storage, Blake3 must be installed.

```sh
  # Install on Unix/macOS
  python3 -m pip install "blake3"
  # Install on Windows
  py -m pip install "blake3"
```

**Please Note:** The macro will work without this _Blake3_ library, the only difference is that the files in the CADBase storage (cloud) that have already been uploaded will not be replaced.

### First start

After it is installed on the above location, it will be available in the macros menu.  

Open **Macro** in the ToolBar, select **Macros...**, choose the _CadbaseLibrary.FCMacro_ macro and execute.

On first run, the macro will ask you for the location of your library.  
This location can be changed in the macro settings in the field _Library path_.

#### Getting an authorization token

In the _CADBase library_ window, on the **Options** tab, click the **Settings** button.  
When the _CADBase library configuration_ window opens, you need to set a **username** and **password** in order to access CADBase.  
After entering these data to receive the token and pressing the **OK** button. Please wait until you receive the token.

**Important Note:**  If the access token has expired, you need to repeat the steps above.

## Usage

Add target components to bookmarks (favorites) on the CADBase site.  
In FreeCAD will only display components that the user has bookmarked on CADBase, as well as those that have been previously downloaded.

### Getting data

Clicking **Update components** only updates the list of components from bookmarks active user, without downloading component modifications and files.  

Double-clicking on a components folder to get a list of modifications for component.

Getting files of a fileset for FreeCAD occurs after double-clicking on a modification folder.

### Sending data

Select the modification from which you want to upload files.  

Click the **Upload files** button for upload local files of select modification folder to CADBase storage (cloud).  

Information about the upload process will be displayed in the log.  
After uploading the files, a message will be displayed in the log with information about the number of successfully uploaded files.

## Info

In FreeCAD, you can find which is your user **modules folder** by entering or pasting `App.getUserAppDataDir()+"Mod"` and your usr **macros folder** by entering `App.getUserMacroDir()` in the Python console (found under menu View->Panels)

If you need to save logs to a file (for example, for debugging, studying, or other purposes), you need to create a `cadbase_file_2018.log` file in the local library folder.

Please don't use `cadbase_file_2018` and `cadbase_file_2018.log` as file or folder names in the CADBase library folder. These files store server responses and logs, if you use these filenames for your data, you may lose them.

To avoid losing local data when downloading from CADBase storage, files already in local storage are skipped when downloading from the cloud.

Before uploading files to the cloud (CADBase storage), the macro checks for existing files on the cloud and excludes files from an upload list if their local and cloud hashes are the same. A hash is calculated using the Blake3 library.

This check is skipped and previously downloaded files (whe already in the cloud) are not updated if the Blake3 library is not installed.
